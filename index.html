            Imagine there is a code able to solve every sort of problem you may
            find. The kind of code everyone (around the world) would be eager to
            work with; that desired code trained to defeat the very common
            "bugs". Stop thinking. Rumour has it that it already exists, and has
            been created by a team of five super women by means of using their
            maximun strength to make it happen. They, that once were laypersons
            in this field, have decided to open the door and crossed the other
            side, beyond the interface. Five women that have chosen to stay,
            grow and be mutually supportive in this amazing technological world.
            So, what are you waiting for? Knock the door!

            not enough for me. It turned out that there are so many ways to make
            the world a better place. It was the point when I took on making
            worth from IT department hereinafter in order to make life easier as
            a developer. As a Social Worker, I am able to solve problems through
            soft skills like teamwork or communication. As a multifaceted, I am
            willing to get my life with wit, persistence and patience. Indeed, I

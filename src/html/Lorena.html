      Imagine there is a code able to solve every sort of problem you may find.
      The kind of code everyone (around the world) would be eager to work with;
      that desired code trained to defeat the very common "bugs". Stop thinking!
      Rumour has it that it already exists, and has been created by a team of
      five super women by means of using their maximun strength to make it
      happen. They, that once were laypersons in this field, have decided to
      open the gate and crossed the other side, beyond the interface. Five women
      that have chosen to stay, grow and be mutually supportive in this amazing
      technological world. So, what are you waiting for? Knock the door!

      "Wow!â€¦have to say that one of our best strengths is to be called "Eleven
      Code". If you've seen Stranger Things, you might know what we're talking
      about, so, don't you think ELEVEN is an incredible girl? The truth is we
      identify ourselves with that COURAGE, that TEAMWORK spirit and ,above all,
      that RESILIENCE that has, therefore, a STRONG and POWERFUL code, made up
      of five extraordinary WOMEN"

      "Coming from very different worlds and starting a project remotely, due to
      the current circumstances that have touched us (for ex. covid), could be
      factors that play against anyone of us, and even more when we want to make
      an approach with you, our client, or even more, with ourselves as a team.
      However, we are committed to improve every single day and offer you always
      the best, despite any situation and regardless of our background".

              not enough for me. It turned out that there are so many ways to make
              the world a better place. It was the point when I took on making

              a developer. As a Social Worker, I am able to solve problems through
              soft skills like teamwork or communication. As a multifaceted, I am
              willing to get my life with wit, persistence and patience. Indeed, I
